# Strategic Foundations

<!--
PCE → Traditional PM Mapping:
This file = Your product roadmap + OKRs + positioning
Purpose: Define current strategic priorities and market focus
Update frequency: Quarterly or when strategy pivots
Use: Guide AI to understand what's in scope vs out of scope

This is the "north star" for tactical decisions. When AI suggests features,
it should check if they align with objectives here.
-->

## 1. Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)
* **Objective**: [e.g., Become the #1 Tool for Legal Compliance]
    * *KR 1*: [Metric]
    * *KR 2*: [Metric]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Objective**: Become the go-to platform for legal AI compliance by Q2 2026

**Key Results**:
* **KR 1**: Reach 10,000 MAU (Monthly Active Users) by end of Q2 2026
* **KR 2**: Achieve 500 paying teams ($50k MRR)
* **KR 3**: 80% of users complete onboarding within 10 minutes
* **KR 4**: <5% monthly churn rate

**Why these metrics?**
- MAU = Product-market fit signal
- Paying teams = Revenue validation
- Onboarding completion = Activation success
- Churn rate = Retention health
-->

## 2. Target Market Strategy
* **Primary Segment**: [e.g., B2B Enterprise Law Firms]
* **Value Driver**: [e.g., Security & Auditability over Speed]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Primary Segment**: Startup Product Managers (teams of 5-20)

**Characteristics**:
- 28-45 years old, 3-10 years PM experience
- Previously used Jira/Asana and found them too rigid
- Technical enough to use Git/CLI but prefer UI
- Building B2B SaaS products (not consumer apps)

**Value Driver**: Speed to ship > Enterprise features
- They need workflow flexibility, not heavyweight processes
- AI-first development is their competitive advantage
- Context amnesia is their #1 pain point with current tools

**Why NOT Enterprise?** (Future pivot, not now)
- Enterprise requires: SSO, SOC2, custom contracts (6-12 month sales cycles)
- Startup PMsat can start using immediately (credit card, self-serve)
- We'll move upmarket in Q3 2026, not before
-->

## 3. Positioning Statement
> For [Target Customer], [Product Name] is the [Category] that [Key Benefit]. Unlike [Competitor], we [Unique Differentiator].

<!-- EXAMPLE:
> For startup Product Managers using AI coding tools, Product Context Engineering is the
> vibe coding framework that prevents product drift and constraint violations. Unlike traditional
> PM tools (Jira, Asana) that focus on task management, we focus on product context management -
> ensuring AI builds the right thing, not just any thing.

**Competitive Differentiation**:
- **vs Jira/Asana**: They manage tasks, we manage product context for AI
- **vs Notion**: They give you blank pages, we give you structure for AI consumption
- **vs No Framework**: We add product rigor without killing vibe coding velocity
-->

## 4. Product Roadmap (High Level)
* **Q1**: Focus on Foundation (Scalability).
* **Q2**: Focus on Expansion (New Features).

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Q1 2026**: Foundation - Prove the framework works
- ✅ Core templates (project_brief, PRDs, tech_stack, system_patterns)
- ✅ Documentation (README, AI_INTEGRATION, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- ✅ Public GitHub launch
- ⏳ 50 early adopters using framework
- ⏳ Collect feedback, iterate on templates

**Q2 2026**: Expansion - Make it easy to adopt
- 🔲 IDE extensions (workspace integrations for auto-context injection)
- 🔲 CLI tool (pce init, pce create-prd, pce promote)
- 🔲 Examples repo (filled templates for common use cases)
- 🔲 Community platform (GitHub Discussions or Discord)
- 🔲 Target: 500 users, 10+ community contributions

**Q3 2026**: Scale - Enterprise features
- 🔲 Team collaboration features (PRD approvals, context reviews)
- 🔲 Analytics (track AI accuracy improvements over time)
- 🔲 Integrations (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues)
- 🔲 Target: 5,000 users, first enterprise customer

**Out of Scope** (Explicitly NOT building):
- ❌ Task management / project tracking (use Linear/Jira for that)
- ❌ Time tracking / resource planning (not our focus)
- ❌ AI model hosting (we're context, not infrastructure)
-->

## 5. Pricing & Business Model
* [e.g., SaaS Subscription per Seat]

<!-- EXAMPLE:
**Current**: Free and open-source (building adoption)
- Framework templates: Free forever (MIT License)
- Community support: GitHub Discussions

**Q3 2026**: Freemium model
- **Free Tier**: Core templates, community support
- **Pro Tier** ($15/user/month): IDE extensions, CLI tools, priority support
- **Team Tier** ($49/user/month): Collaboration features, analytics, integrations

**Why freemium?**
- Aligns incentives: free tier drives adoption, paid tier funds development
- Network effects: more users = better templates = more value
- Low barrier to entry for solo founders, scales with team growth

**Revenue Target**: $50k MRR by end of Q2 2026 (assumes 500 paying users at avg $25/month)
